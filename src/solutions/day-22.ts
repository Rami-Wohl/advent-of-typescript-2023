// Reindeer Sudoku
// Santa's reindeer sure do like to cause trouble! This time they've decided to make a game out of arranging themselves into a Sudoku board.

// Before arranging themselves in this configuration, the reindeer left Santa a foreboding message:

// SaNtA.... yOu MuSt ImPleMeNt ThE Validate TyPe To DeTerMinE WhEThEr OuR SuDokU ConFiGuRaTiOn Is vALid

// Oh.. and what's that... also Vixen seems to have left a separate note

// make sure Validate is a predicate

// Vixen
// Well that's sorta condescending. Vixen seems to be assuming we already know that a "predicate" is just a fancy computer science term for a function that returns true or false. Oh well. That's Vixen for you.

// What is Sudoku
// If you're not already familiar: Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. Here are the basic rules:

// Grid Structure: The game is played on a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids or "regions."
// Number Placement: The objective is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9.
// Row Constraint: Every row must contain each number from 1 to 9 without repeating.
// Column Constraint: Every column must also contain each number from 1 to 9 without repeating.
// Region Constraint: Each of the nine 3x3 regions must contain each number from 1 to 9, again without repetition.
// Normally you solve the puzzle by logically deducing the numbers for the empty cells, ensuring that all rows, columns, and 3x3 regions have numbers from 1 to 9 according to the rules. However, in this case the cells are all already filled in and your mission is to instead determine whether the configuration follows the rules of Sudoku.
